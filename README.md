The Astar class gets the path from one of 4 different classes that each implement a different version of the algorithm.
I did this to test out how my algorithm improvement with the new additions.
In the scene you can find a GameManager where you can select which algorithm you want to use.
The yellow gizmos balls show on tiles that have been checked by the algorithm and in the console you can find the path stats.
